Aakriti's leave request got approved, finally, after six months. She was very exicited for her vacation. She was an overprotected young girl whose life revolved around a handful of people who were loving, caring, and contented. Fed of her mediocre life, she wanted to experience the ugly side of humanity.

She decided to go on a vacation, all alone.

Tarun was both happy and worried. He wasn't sure how Aakriti will manage without him. She had never gone outstation without him in last 7 years. "Are you sure you don’t want your bodyguard?" Tarun said, in a loving voice.

She gave her pullover the last turn to fold it compactly. She adjusted it in an overfilled, Swaine Adeney Brigg’s Windsor leather bag that Tarun got for her from New York, last month, on her 25th birthday. She walked towards Tarun who was seated on a wingback accent chair. She sat on his lap. She could see the fear in his eyes. They kissed.

convincingly, she said, "Baby, I'll be fine."

"Ya, I know you will be. It's just you are not even taking your phone along, so I'm a little worried."

"Don’t be. It's just two weeks. I want to be just with myself."

Tarun wanted Aakriti to break her dogma that contentedness is malediction. Soon after the trip they plan to become parent, so she may not get this chance again. He knew this trip was the best way for her to realise how lucky she was to live an affluent life.

For an otherwise detailed planner, it wasn't easy for her to not plan for the trip. She didn't check for travel options, hotel, or weather. The only thing she googled was "India's most dangerous place", and 'Bastar' became her destination.

In the heist, she understood the universal purpose of life. It was to obtain an unshakable spirit or in plain words, lasting joyfulness. Most people think their career, family, or job titles are the reasons for their living. But those are not the ultimate purpose of life but rather short or mid-term goals.

Animals are familiar with objective entities outside them, such as trees, rocks and rivers, and subjective experiences within them, such as fear, joy and desire. Humans, in addition, are concious of money, gods, nations and corporations. The Cognitive ability enables humans to start talking about things that existed only in their own imagination. These fictious ideas helps in collaborationa and effective cooperation. Today, corporations are fictional legal entities that own property, lend money, hire employees and initiate economic enterprises.

Rahul ensured that his sister, sleeping next to him, was unconscious. He gathered the courage to step out of the cozy bed in the chilly winter night and walked straight to the living room, slowly and swiftly. Switched on the TV, lowered the volume to zero, and turned on Fashion TV. Like all 10 years old boys , he was both innocent and inquisitive, all he wanted to know what's hidden behind the clothes. As an adolescent, he dreamed of unrevealing the secrets of the opposite sex.

Ramesh Pratap, his father, was a Junior Engineer with UP Jal Nigam. His mother was a housewife, and his house, flat no. B12, Jal Nigam colony in the interior of Dehradun, had a porch below the balcony of B13, from where he could see Ada.

There was no body who could reveal the secret, neither his parents nor teachers. He can’t discuss girls, masturbation, or any sexual matter with them; and asking friends was a stupidity, they were all equally ignorant. The only ray of hope was Ada, which was why he was hoping that one day, he would take her far away with him so that they could demystify the world together.

The day arrived soon. Ada’s mother convinced his mother for Ada to join his private math tuition. They talked, became friends and started spending time in his porch and her balcony for hours discussing everything, but maths. His longing for her wasn’t love, or anything else, but merely a quest.

Mrinalini was mortally afraid of death. Although, the reasons were many, but the thought that was scaring her the most was - have I done enough that I can die? This feeling was making the death terrifying for her each passing day. She was in the last stages of cancer nearing death. She wanted to do many things. If many were not possible, at-least one thing. And that was to gift her husband their first baby who was in her womb.

One day, my 4 years old daughter comes to and asks...Who defines what is normal. Is cheating wrong? when we say men are superior to women, are we not cheating.

Assets vs. liabilities. Invest in assets. good friends are assets, bad are liabilities. Irony is that when u invest in liability, u think its an asset.
